## Running 

1. Run 1.0-sm-initial-eda-and-cleaning* first
2. Then either of 1.1-sm-feature-engineering* or 1.4-sm-feature-engineering* files can be run based on whether we want to do full feature engineering or just location specific.
3. Then corresponding 1.2-sm-modelling* or 1.5-sm-modelling-location* needs to be run for model training
4. A general analysis of cuisine vs. location vs. stars can be run via 1.3-sm-location-cuisine-stars*, needs to be run after step 1 above.


## Notes

1. All *.py files are python script versions of jupyter notebooks of the same name.
2. All yelp*csv files are the raw training datasets downsampled to 300 records
3. Plots generated by the analyses are in the figs directory
4. NOTE that, none of the scripts (except 1.0-sm-initial-eda-*) would work on the downsampled dataset. Full data is present here - https://www.yelp.com/dataset
