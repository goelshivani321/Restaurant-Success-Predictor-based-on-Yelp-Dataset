0,GRWIABHedj1m8DDoAuTIMg,P15wklW4dVsfh5S_nYj3oA,2016-10-10,This place is a RIPOFF that's all I can say. DONT GO HERE REGARDLESS IF YOU HAVE A BUZZ OR NOT THEY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU!!! They will charge you for the preliminary $20 short lap dance even if they don't do nothing for you or not. There's no such thing as charge you $20 first then all the way for $100 later on. This is a place if you want to waste your money.
