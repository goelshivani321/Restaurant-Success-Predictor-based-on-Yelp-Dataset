<h1> Restaurant Success Predictor based on Yelp Dataset(Group Project, CMPE255 - Fall, 18)</h1>

This project was a submission for major project for Data Mining class().
I conducted the analysis of the business, cuisine and geo-location features present 
in the publicly available Yelp dataset (6.84GB) using Python. The major steps included 
feature engineering, clustering nearby restaurants using DBScan to predict zip codes to 
run a successful restaurant business based on noise, footfall and cuisine;  and data modeling. 
GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV were used for hyper parameter tuning and mean accuracy 
was used as the evaluation metric. Gradient boosted trees, Decision Tree and 
Random Forest Classifier were used to predict the restaurant success. 

Technologies: Python, DBScan, GridSearchCV, RandomizedsearchCV, scikit-learn, Gradient boosted trees, Decision tree, Anaconda, jupyter notebooks
