We ordered two sushi rolls (very reasonably priced), a couple dishes of nigiri, and two hand rolls. Our favorite was hands down the salmon belly nigiri. The salmon was so fresh and fatty, it melted in our mouths. We also liked the garlic tuna nigiri. The hand rolls were a little bit too spicy, but nonetheless we had a great first dining experience here. Will definitely be back :)",X9actWsKQhcZ2dh-ToH7wQ,1

It's close to our apartments, the food is good, it's relatively cheap and the lively Mariachi music is always a bonus.  I think the wait staff has seen us so much that they kind of hate us. We're not the table that orders pitcher after pitcher of margaritas, so they know we're not big spenders. And we always have special requests- enchilada sauce on a tostada or a taco with black beans instead of meat. They always honor our requests though and it keeps us coming back for more. I know that my brother loves their Mexican pizza and the fajita chimichanga, while Lolita prefers the pollo fundido. This is a great spot to go for happy hour because the margaritas are cheap and the attentive servers in the bar area keep them flowing freely.  Select appetizers are specially priced during happy hour and there is also a reverse happy hour starting at 9pm too I believe.  Sometimes I see a tall, gray haired man watching over the diners from the hostess station and I can't help but wonder: Carlos, is that you?

Cuts of fish were fresh but small. Too much rice for a small piece of fish.  Also very thinly sliced. Teriyaki chicken was precooked with sauce poured over. Pretty dry.  Could be different chef.

3,1,2013-04-26,HuyAINy8Gx3IZcW6h8Z_1Q,bgm4lBsot9hn9mFv_p-NZg,0,"I went here for a pedicure based on the yelp reviews. The price was decent for a spa pedicure ($25.) However, I decided to add on gel instead of regular polish which was another $20 (which is pretty standard as well.) So here's the deal... 

1. STAFF
Staff was fairly nice. All three people spoke to me and I didn't have to wait long to get into the chair. 

2. PRODUCT
So this is why they only get three stars. I choose gel because a gel pedicure should last longer. (FYI- I also made sure to choose the OPI gel product because some of the other gels are not as good.) The pedicure looked good for about two days then it began to look like the gel was lifting. This was definitely related to the mediocre application of the gel product. The tech somewhat rushed and was somewhat sloppy so the result was lack luster. Disappointing! 

3. CUSTOMER SERVICE
Another thing I was somewhat... Eh, about was the fact that they charged me for a big toe fill. (FYI- I have acrylic on my big toes because they have a tendency to brake on me.) Most places will comp the fill when you are getting a spa pedicure and gel as a courtesy because of the amount of money your spending. Not here they charged me. (This affected the tip to the tech because I felt some type of way about it.) 

Overall I will not be back to this nail salon because I was overall not that impressed with the finished product.",dgVJzkjTHapHRloRKYv4bA,0

Both kids said they'd never seen a laser-tag course of its ilk: three stories high and incredibly well designed with nooks and crannies. I just wish that pint-sized brats weren't allowed after certain hours.

Kudos to the management for refunding my money when I was forced out of half a game due to my gun not working.

It's literally overwhelming. When I decided to take the leap and just try something, maybe I was a little biased to the company's name, having grown up on the east side suburbs of the namesake.

But in a sea of mediocre skin care and beauty supply, Chagrin Valley Soap & Salve is the real deal...and they have the yummiest flavors EVER.

I've always been lucky to have pretty good skin, aside from being super pale and having a sometimes uneven skin tone. My skin also doesn't react well to really strong things, because my skin is just average and doesn't need any harsh work. Because of that, its always been hard to find things that keep it consistent and healthy without irritating it. I love the citrus & sugar facial cleansing scrub and the chocolate & honey soap for this purpose alone. It moisturizes, exfoliates and doesn't smell ridiculous (no added scents!) or have weird chemicals. While everything smells delicious and is perfectly crafted, you're not putting anything weird on your body. New motto: if you can understand all the ingredients on the back, you win life.

"" DONT DO IT"". 2 guys 1 fake beard, a dress and cow bell... enough said. We then walke over to the petting zoo that they have.

During both check-in and check-out we knew we were hitting them at their busiest times, so we were expecting to wait. But at both 4 pm Saturday and 10 am Friday Paris felt the need to have only have 3 associates supporting check out and 2 of them were dedicated to their Platinum clients. Ridiculous. When the 'mob' waiting to check in or check out start to get upset and their anger is feeding off each other it is not a good experience to start or end with. There was one of the person distributing keys, but they were dedicated to check in people that had used the automated system, which according to many people was flaky. Hey Paris, if you have only one person helping the average customer, and that associate gets bogged down by one irate customer, the line doesn't move for 15 minutes and people get pissed.

Probably what made me more disappointed than anything during our check-in/check-out time was the reaction of management. We saw at least two managers that were aware of the problems yet I never saw them roll up their sleeves and help their customers AND THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES.

It also appeared that every single Diner or restaurant was understaffed, except of course the two most expensive. When a diner is only 1/3 full but you have a line waiting because you only have one slow Hostess seating people, that is ridiculous. And the wait for a person to come by your table should not be measured in quarter hours.

We also paid for a cabana for one day at the pool. Here the Staffing was sufficient and pleasant, but would it have been so hard to take a leaf blower and get the crud off the ground before we arrive?

Of course there were always manned tables in the casino to take your money, and many times they had no customers sitting at them. But the rest of the staff seemed completely overworked and unenthused.

I did feel that Paris earned at least two stars, maybe a third if I'm feeling generous, because the rooms were very nice. Most of the associates were pleasant. Overall the food was very good in all the locations

Well the place is small and intimate which I really loved but it wasn't everything that I suspected it would be. The service was just so so.

The edamame was way over cooked and that is seriously the simpliest thing to make- its just blanched soy beans. Anywho- the one of the rolls I ordered had bay scallops inside which had some kind of mint inside which added to the flavor. If created a nice woodsy/citrusy flavor that was a great addition. But my cousin ordered the spring rolls which had this same mint and some kind of other flavor that was so overbearing it destroyed the simple an light flavors that are so familiar in a fresh spring roll.

It all started innocently enough.  I decided to get another credit card, and there were amazing rewards with free groceries, all sorts of gift certificates to different companies, etc.

Their online website was a bit late 1990s, but hey, it was fine!  it did what I needed it to do!  Besides, I was always someone who pays my bills on time, so I didn't care about fees or interest.  

Then, all of a sudden, as I was redeeming my PC points, I realized that you could only do it for Loblaw groceries.  That was OK since we all need groceries, but why wasn't I told?  

Then, they started giving you less points for the amount you spent.  What incentive was there to stay really?  I was using $30 a month on it.  

So, I decided to log into my account to see what was going on... only to find that they had changed the entire interface and I no longer remembered my password.  So, I tried a couple, then it locked me out.  So I tried calling PC Mastercard to reset it... I was on hold for a half hour before I frustratingly gave up.  I tried the next day.  On hold for half an hour. AGAIN. 

I called again the next day, and I finally got through after 20 minutes.  I decided at that point that they had wasted enough of my time and there was no point in having this card any more.  I cancelled it, but before I did that I asked them to tell me if I had any remaining balance on the account so I could pay it off.  They told me I did not.  

So, two months pass and I no longer have this card.  In the mail, I get a notice saying that I owe PC Mastercard some money.

WTF!  They told me I paid everything off!  

I angrily called them demanding why suddenly there was outstanding payments on it.  I cancelled my card months earlier.  They told me that there were a couple charges from a couple weeks before the card was cancelled, and they said it probably wasn't posted at the time.  Now.... it would make sense if it was 2 or 3 days after, but 3 weeks?  And for that matter, charges for Loblaw, who runs this bank with CIBC?  Now that is just plain ridiculous.  

The person on the other line was condescending and rude.  He said that since I had closed my account, there was nothing he could do about the charges.  His manager apparently also could not help.  The whole operation is a complete sham!

It's a perfect place to take a date with it's relaxing, modern atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because our server was horrible but the rest of the experience was memorable.

We arrived for dinner during their happy hour so we were able to order from the tapas menu, which we used as appetizers. Unfortunately they were out of their roasted artichoke so we settled for the cheese stuffed mushrooms. These baby portabellas were quite enjoyable. I would describe in depth but all it took me was one bite! 

We then proceeded to order from the dinner menu and hey a nice steak dinner for 2 people under $70 is good in my book. 

First up, the bread. Wow, it probably was the best bread basket I've had in a while or maybe I was just really hungry! The pretzel rolls had a nice fluff to them and were warm. Now the best deal are the classic dinners. My partner ordered the chicken Milanese and it was actually really good. The chicken was moist and the breading was fried perfectly that it provided a nice crispy crust. The meal also came with 2 sides and a salad for around . The salad was a spring mix with homemade balsamic vinaigrette. The dressing was actually really enjoyable. The consistency was perfect, not too thick and not too thin. The two sides were mash potatoes and broccolini. Luckily the taters didn't taste as processed as some of the other joints but you can tell it was fresh homemade mash taters. Overall this meal was enjoyed.

So it's really hard to go to a steakhouse and not order a steak, of course I had to try their steak. I ordered the 8 oz filet Mignon with mac & cheese and asparagus. The filet Mignon was so tender, it just melted in your mouth. The only downside to my steak was that it was a bit dry. However, it didn't stop me from devouring that luscious piece of meat!. My only suggestion to the staff would be to possibly add a beef broth/gravy ramekin on the side in case the steak is dry. But I am a true believer that the best steak is one with no sauces/gravys or over seasoned, just salt & pepper. Now again it's hard to screw up asparagus but all you have to do is steam them and add salt. The mac & cheese, eh I've had better.

Again, it's a great place for a romantic dinner where you don't have to spend a lot of money for a steak. Afterwards, enjoy a cocktail at the Mermaid bar by the tank or the flare bar. The employees are great and actually run the food out quickly (trust me, they sprint that food out to you). Yes our server Rob (oops did I just say that out loud?) was not the best and took him forever to come to our table and would forget to bring stuff. C'mon dude get it together, it wasn't that busy.

I would definitely go back for dinner, hopefully we get someone different next time!",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,0

My hubby noticed that there wasn't any chicken on his salad so he let them know right away that he asked for chicken.  So for our meal of full kale quinoa salad with chicken and extra pistachios, a half salad and soup, along with a drink cost us a bit over $20.

I liked my salad, but the soup wasn't a wow as it was creamy and sweet, vs the tartness that I was looking for.  Also, the half salad alone filled me up.  Our meal came with a slice of baguette and choco dipped strawberry.

Overall, I did enjoy the freshness of the salad, the easiness of ordering, and the cleanliness of the spot.  We will return.",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,3

So I decided to give this place a try after reading other Yelper's visit. Toshi Ryoriten got really nice decor. And I agree with other posts, finally a Japanese places uptown! 

Let's start off with venue, it is very nicely decorated and very clean. At the entrance has this classic Japanese style wooden door like motif. And once you get inside is more modern and nicely lit. 

Onto the food... Not bad, not too over powering in terms of flavour. My friend and I ordered a marinated cod (Gindara), spicy salmonl, yellow-tail and green onion (Negihamachi) plus rainbow rolls plus the shiitake mushroom stuffed with surimi shrimp paste (Shiitake Shinjo). The food aren't bad, as I mentioned the flavour isn't overpowering. The fish was quite fresh. And the texture of the rice does have certain authentic Japanese sushi rice taste. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is casual and not too loud, where one can have a conversation with a date. The servers aren't bad, they tend to me as often as they could given the busy schedule they have.",97ZsoydQYxhmQ-XnsxbDog,0

I am happy to see other reviews of this place that were positive. I am sure you got a different cook than I!
Was meeting a colleague here for lunch, we just needed to decide on something quick close to Northland Mall. This is where we picked!
I had never been, never had heard of this place before, being from out of province originally. We walked inside and were left standing at the front of the restaurant for far too long before being seated. This place looked ok, nothing too special, a teeny bit shabby but I was hoping for a nice meal as I was starving as was my colleague. I swear, this menu gives Denny's a run for its money in terms of items they serve. The menu must be 10 pages front and back, I am not kidding. They do have some lunch items that won't break the bank but all of the other menu items appeared to be quite expensive. I ordered just a chicken taco salad for $16.99 - cannot screw that up too badly right? And I ordered a cup of coffee that I hoped was VERY good for $4 a cup. I might as well have thrown a shot of Baileys in it - how much more could it have been? My friend got a house salad and a French Onion Soup. The food took quite awhile which was funny as the place was not super busy. The salads finally came and then strangely, the soup came a good 15 minutes later when the 2 items were to be served together. But anyways, back to my sloppy mess - it was small cubes of frozen (""spicy"" = not) chicken drowned in bad canned salsa which was then dumped all over my salad! Which by the way had maybe 3 radish pieces in it and 3 carrot slices. Pathetic. If the ranch dressing, sour cream, guac and extra salsa come on the side, why drown my meal in red goo making it almost inedible.
I did get free coffee refills. And I thought the server was OK until my colleague asked me, ""Did you see those huge dangling GUN earrings she is wearing?"" I had not, oh boy, time to get the bill and get going! I did get a piece of Cheesecake to take home to the man thinking - well, that is their name, the Cheesecake Company so the cakes should be good? Am I just too trusting or what? The cheesecake was horrible, I just cannot in good conscience recommend the key lime cheesecake. That is so sad! Key Lime is supposed to make people happy-happy and it was just a disaster. I am not sure how they got the cheesecake itself green, I would have picked a different slice had I known!

For our mains we got the lobster fettuccine and the steak frites. The steak frites was cooked really well, juicy and came with a good portion of fries. I must say that they really do make delicious aioli sauces because the truffle aioli really made the fries! The only downside was that the steak was a bit salty. The lobster fettuccine was REALLY good! It was a generous portion of lobster and the pasta was rich/ creamy - the way fettuccine should be! To end off the night we got the sticky toffee pudding. It was a good portion - enough for both of us to share. The cake was dense and moist but we actually found it a bit salty.

My passenger side mirror in my Mini Cooper needed to be replaced and repainted because I hit a construction cone. I took it to Ozzie and Tonya and they went above and beyond and my new mirror cap repainted. It matches absolutely perfect and looks like nothing aver happened. Thank you guys so much for doing excellent work and having such great customer service. I will refer anybody to you if they ever need any body work. 


I had a great experience with AW Collision. This was my second time using their services. First time (about 4 years ago)  I had an accident in my Volvo C30 (not my fault lol), and the repairs were flawless like nothing happened. Their customer service and communication back then was so good that I decided to use them again this time around for my Mini Cooper. There was debris on the freeway and I could not avoid it and it did a lot of damage to the bumper and fender. I bought the mini in Portland from a dealership almost 3 years ago. That dealership lied to me when I asked them if it had prior damage/ accidents and they said no. 6 months later in this hot and dry climate my paint started cracking on the hood and progressively spread and got worse because there was damage and they did a Mickey Mouse job on repairing it. So I figured I'll just get that repaired as well while my car was there already to get that other damage repaired. Once again it looks flawless and better than new. The customer service from everyone there  is great, they explained everything in detail to me. From what they were going to repair, to why my paint had cracked, to the quality products that they use and why. You get a lifetime guarantee as well which makes me happy and confident that they stand by their work. I've had two separate great experiences and I will refer people and use them again myself (hopefully not anytime soon lol). I brought my car in kinda dirty and when I picked it up it was so clean on the inside and out! That too made me super happy because I was planning to get and nice car wash after I picked it up and now I did not have to.

Out of the last three times I've gone there and asked to be seated at a booth ( after being asked if I had a reservation which I didn't) I was told they were all reserved but I could sit at the bar.  Each time I sit at the bar and enjoy my meal for over an hour whilst I am in an otherwise empty restaurant full of multiple empty booths. Who are these reserved for?  The one time I did make a reservation and arrived at the appointed time I was told there was an hour wait for a booth....while in view of four or five empty ones. When I complained I was immediately seated...... At the bar.    What is the managerial strategy here? Are they short staffed? Are they steering tipping customers to the bar tender/ server? Are there imaginary customers only they can see?   Weird.,WFCbJtjiHSPopCb8_jqnsw,0

They have a variety of pastas, burgers, pizzas. We had their pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza which was pretty big for $13 the pepperoni was a bit salty, but I thought it was really delicious. We also had their chicken marinara pasta with mozzarella super yummy after a night of drinking. They also have free bread which is great for a starter.

Came in for lunch and was greeted and seated quickly. Although there was only one server, she was very quick and attentive. We got takoyaki, pork gyoza, and chicken karage for appetizer and I got the spicy tonkatsu ramen and my best friend got the house black. Everything was delicious! 

Pros:
+ The broth is so satisfyingly savory but not heavy to make you feel sick of it.
+ the sliced pork the ramen came with was nice and tender and just melts in your mouth
+ takoyaki is crispy on the outside but light and fluffy in the inside with a decent size of octopus. Hands down the best I've had. They sauced it perfectly! 
+ the chicken karage is so fresh and they give you a ton, felt like that could have been a meal of its own.

Cons:
- the noodles were a little on the soft side, would love if they were a little chewier
- the pork gyoza was not that impressive. I would skip this if you plan on ordering other appetizers. 
- the ramen came with seasoned egg and we thought it would be soft boil but it wasn't, would ask for it to be soft boil next time. 

I ordered my food as is to taste how it comes but definitely would do add on to my ramen next time.

Beautifully, but subtly, decorated for the Christmas holidays.  Spacious floor plan where your table isn't on top of the family next to you. It was dimly lit, inviting and cozy. 

Because we were such a large group, we were tucked into a long oval table that just about had its own zip code! We had one dedicated server--probably could have used two given the size of our party.  Our dining experience lasted close to four hours, which was just too long.  We did have an outside wedding cake brought in and the restaurant was gracious enough. to serve it.

It's a good thing too because the entire front of their cafe is made of doors (all locked by the way) so in the brutal cold of winter, I (and many others), played the age-old game of entrance Russian roulette...

Attempt #1 - *pull*, strain, FAIL. 
Attempt #2 - *pull*, strain, FAIL. ""OK SERIOUSLY WTF I'M FREEZING HERE""
Attempt #3 - *pull*, strain, FAIL. ""WHY GOD? WHY DO YOU HATE ME""
Attempt # 4 *pull*, door opens, immediately falls inside and thanks god above on high #blessings

Once I made it past the door level, dried my frozen tears from my cheeks, and let my glasses defog, it was only then that I could take in the quaint French Cafe vibe of Lucullus AND I understood why all the doors, cuz in the summertime... it's open to the outside Parisian cafe style... (ohhhhhhhhhhh).

Cruising around inside I was thoroughly impressed with their selection of both traditional French and Chinese pastries and bread. To fairly review them I had to pick something familiar as a basis for comparison and picked up a Pain au Chocolate (Chocolate croissant) and paired it with a black coffee. 

The Croissant was massive, light, airy and fluffy. However, the dough was lacking in the distinct buttery texture and flavour that melts in your mouth when tearing into a fresh croissant. Instead, I found it slightly sweet but a little more on the bland side. Still tasty and visually stunning (you know from the Yelp.. and the gram). The coffee was nice and paired nicely, however, the teeny tiny diner-style cups were sad and spilt easily and honestly didn't do much to match the classy French aesthetic going here.

So why a three? A Three-star average means A-OK. Nothing was bad, but nothing knocked my socks off either. The x-factor which faltered a bit here, which is kinda become typical for certain businesses in Markham, was the standoffish, seemingly disengaged staff. Again, a place putting all this effort into an exceptional product should encourage staff to be part of that product - I honestly get more personality from the folks at Tim Hortons and their croissants are ONLY made with butter.

I'll come back to re-test them based on their Chinese dessert offerings. Look forward to it

Online, I've seen a lot of people complaining about the pricing... but when you consider each game costs anywhere from $10-60 (sometimes beyond) to own privately, there are 1500+ to choose from, and you can play pretty much as long as you want to... how is this not economical?
I would agree that food and refreshments can take a while. Personally I don't usually order anything much more complicated than a mug of coffee ($1.75) and something small to munch on (~$2-3.00). I would suspect the slow service because they have a very limited kitchen facility, and few staff. They do create the sandwiches fresh to order, which I give them kudos for, because they could easily bring in pre-fab crap and speed up the food distribution.",HwWvld5Yd0h0EHrydo9CFQ,0

We ordered some sort of different kinds of meat platter that was made to feed 2 people, which was 40$, and was the most expensive thing on the menu, but when you think about it, since it's written that it's for 2 people, it's really 20$. What we got could have easily fed an extra person fully, and it all tasted amazing xp The steaks were so tender and as delicious as the way my dad makes it at home, and the fillet mignon on the skewers were to die for xp They were huge and juicy and oh so tender xp We ordered it medium rare, asking for it to be more on the rare side. Nothing tasted raw or even felt raw, it was just amazing xoxo The porc chops that came with it were not bad, a bit on the dry side for me, but my bf still liked it. The chicken was way too dry for me, I didn't finish it, but my bf still liked it a lot. The potato slices tasted really good, it was like they were baked AND fried, and soaked up the juices of the meat xp The salad was really something else. Very good portions of different kinds of vegetables, I like the addition of avocados in it, and the salad dressing was also really yummy and a style I'm really not use to but enjoyed experiencing. The meal also came with a spicy green dipping sauce for the meats, which was also very delicious and I couldn't tell what it was made out of. Over the years, I've given up on ordering steaks at restaurants because usually eventhough I ask for something juicy, they give me really dry meat, which I can't stand, so I'm definitely keeping this place right in my memory bank!

The decor was neat inside, a lot of dark woods, we only sat outside in the terr-ass to wait for our food to go, because we had gotten there right before closing time, and they were nice enough to take out order anyway. The workers were very kind and polite, and we didn't have to wait too long for our entire order, which when you think of it, is a lot of meat lol but it was awesome!

While the hostess was a bit brusque, our bartender was helpful. Started out with the Texas Caviar for $2.95 which is a great accompaniment to your beer while waiting for the main course. We decided to share plate the combo platter for $13.95 with burnt ends and turkey with a side of mac'n'cheese and green beans. Both of the sides were okay, but we were more than pleasantly surprised by the meat choices. Moist, yet smokey, with just enough bark. If my belly could've handled it, we would've ordered more meat options. As someone who can get seriously picky about smoked meat, I give Black Dog a thumbs up for serving up finding that balance between succulent but not dry. We also ordered the $2 BBQ sauce sampler which I wanted to drink...so instead we drizzled it on our meat, drizzled it on our mac'n'cheese and drizzled it on our chips.

So, I was in town for a convention...if you must know, it was KBIS.  Last time I was ""conventioning"", I stayed at The Platinum - BORING!  This time, I decided to try something new and SLS was it.

Here are the highs:

I liked the vibe of the place - it's a casino resort with restaurants, bars and shops - all wrapped up in a kinda trendy-cool, but not over-the-top crazy decor.  Fun.

Nice food selection.  I ate at Cleo - loved it (I'll do a separate review).  Umami Burger, Beer Garden & Sports Book for lunch was good.  There were a few other places that looked interesting - for the size of the place, SLS has several solid food choices.

My room was quite comfortable - no issue with size.  Again, I liked the funky decor - much more fun than several other places I've stayed in Vegas.  Loved the ultra fast elevators up/down to the 5th floor.

Pretty close to the Convention Center - I walked back to the SLS on a sunny day (~20 minutes).

Staff was overall pretty friendly - bell hops were excellent.

Lows?  Nothing too low, but worth noting:

Early morning noise from the street (I faced the street with the monorail).  Not horrible, but not super quiet.

Far away from the Strip - not mileage-wise, but far enough that I spent $20 and 1/2 hour in traffic via cab to meet friends at Caesars.  Don't stay at SLS if you plan to spend lots of time on The Strip - traffic sucks in Vegas.  BTW, I didn't try the monorail - it just seemed counter-intuitive to walk to public transit with a beer in my hand.

At check-in, the line was a mile long and they didn't have all the front desk stations open to accommodate the crush of conventioneers.

Smoke present - disliked, but at least it wasn't overwhelming.

Bottom line:

I enjoyed a drink at Monkey Bar, coffee at The Perq, dinner at Cleo and lunch at Umami Burger.  My wife lost $100 on slots, but had fun doing so.  My stay was 2-nights of decent sleep in a nice room - it worked out well.

Duo is a beautiful, minimalist patisserie location and my new favourite breakfast place. It's a clean and tidy area with one row of tables and seats so come early if you want to sit, chill, and enjoy a latte. They've got a glass display filled with fat flaky croissants, artistically designed cakes, and golden brown pastries. I'm not gonna lie, these are some of the best pastries I've ever tasted. The croissants are  $3-$4 and the small cakes are around $6-$8. My boyfriend and I were able to try a variety of things: 

Croissants: The Roast Beef & Mushroom Croissant ($4.00) is the best croissant I've ever eaten in my life. The cheesy exterior was crispy and delicious while the roast beef inside was savoury and soft. We had to get another one after we finished the first. I'm still craving it now... The Salami & Cheese Croissant ($3.50) was also really good but the salami had a spicy kick. The Apple Croissant ($3.50) is rectangular with very thin slices of apple in the middle. This was light and sweet, with creamy custard underneath the apples. It's a really fantastic dessert croissant. 

Mont Blanc ($7.00): This is their famous dessert piece. It has a smooth chestnut swirl surrounding sweet cream with chestnut pieces on top of a buttery tart. It was very enjoyable but also really filling because of all the cream. It wasn't too sweet and was a great size to share. 

Lattes ($4.25): We got a matcha latte and chai tea latte. The chai was very flavourful and had a nice heat. I thought it was a tad too sweet, but still delicious. The matcha latte was smooth and had great green tea flavour. I thought it could've been a bit hotter though. The latte art was also instagram-perfect.  

I had seen a bunch of pictures across social media about Duo and thought that maybe it was one of those ""all style, no substance"" places. I'm so happy to be 100% proven wrong. The owners have got this concept down from the decor, to the food, to the service. I'm excited that something like this is finally in Markham and even more excited visit again soon. :)

Le resto ne fait pas de déjeuner habituellement, c'était donc un test autant pour eux que pour moi. Le menu était fixé à 21$ et ça incluait 1 plat (parmi 3 choix), un macaron et 1 mimosa. Mon amie a essayé les bénédictines au saumon fumé et elle a bien aimé. De mon côté, j'ai essayé la crêpe aux herbes avec le lapin braisé. Les saveurs étaient intéressantes et présentes, mais le plat était malheureusement froid. Les portions étaient plutôt petites, nous avions donc encore faim en quittant le resto. Apres coup, je dirais que considérant la portion des plats, le mimosa ""inclus"" nous est en fait chargé dans le prix. A lui seul, le plat ne vaut vraiment pas le 21$. Malgré que les plats n'étaient vraiment pas mauvais, je ne retournerais pas à l'Autre Version pour le brunch.

They supply all the soaps, towels, grooming supplies, etc. Best of all they take care of the messy tub at the end.. I was surprised at how effortless the process was. We waited about 10 minutes for a tub, washed the dogs ourselves with minimal fuss and were out the door. I didn't ask about aprons, but that would be a nice touch. Also for the colder months I wonder if dryers are supplied. If your dogs are low maintenance dogs who could be hosed down in the backyard, I would totally recommend the Soggy Dog.

The food is fine, but it's nothing special. Probably the best ramen you'd find in Charlotte, but nowhere near the best ramen I've had in my life. Heck, not even in the top 5. It lacks that extra something special, that indescribable quality that would make it craveable. It's not particularly flavorful, which makes me think that their claims of cooking the pork belly all day were a bit of an exaggeration. There was nothing spicy on the table, the meat in the ramen was tough and overcooked, and the egg in the broth was basically just a hard-boiled let down. A soft boiled egg in super hot broth would be way better. 

The izakaya wasn't much better. The waiter pointed out a number of dishes that were ""favorites,"" but nothing stood out as a signature dish. 

The portions were good. The parking lot is spacious, but the location is WEIRD -- it's two doors down from a Family Dollar. What?

Worst part of the dinner was service. The waiter wasn't attentive or any good at remembering our orders. He couldn't tell us apart and totally botched the (uncomplicated, totally expected) bill payment situation. 

I can't see myself going back to YI unless a friend decides to host a birthday party there. There's better food to be had in Charlotte and I only have so many days and dollars to spend in this life so I won't waste any on blah food if I can help it. But the food isn't terrible so if it's convenient for you and you just have a jonesin for some standard, Americanized pan-Asian fare, this isn't a bad bet.",LAwyrUSg6BrQUK3Pr-NK5Q,3

I was told I would have to prepay for the light since it was a special order and the installation would take place once the light was shipped to the store.  

Aqua Sentry pools ordered the incorrect light and performed the installation while I was away for business.   I noticed the light was nowhere near as bright as the old light so I called to let them know they installed the wrong light.   They admitted to installing the wrong light but they actually said they didn't think I would care.   I was in contact with the installer multiple times on the phone during the installation to answer his questions and he never bothered to mention he was installing the incorrect light.  


Aqua Sentry gave me the runaround for weeks and promised to call me back.   It took weeks for me to finally catch the manager on the phone.   He essentially called me a liar and refused to do anything to make this right.  

I am not stuck with a very dim LED light and I was charged over $600 for something I could have bought online for $200. 

Be careful if you plan to do business with these people and make sure you get everything in writing.  I wish I had read the previous reviews before I decided to give them my business.

With sliding floor to ceiling windows, the shop can be fully opened for a breezy shop, which is awesome. 

Upon entrance, the shop is bright, green and fresh. Fresh herbs and small potted plants are the centerpieces for the tables, but it's not your usual setup. It's like a small ecosystem at the center of the shop with artificial and natural lights to activate photosynthesis. Pretty cool concept in my opinion.

The workers are friendly and greet you promptly. Menus are in French, but the workers are helpful so ask questions if you need. Since it was all new to me, I decided to go with Noix-Vocado since it sounded like it would be tasty. I enjoy avocado smoothies, so why not take a chance?

Noix-Vocado: avocats, noisettes, sirop d'erable, chocolat noir, beurre d'arachides, amandes torrefiees, lait d'amandes, bananes tranchees, mueslix, and pêches. It tasted like a date shake. Super creamy and smooth, you could definitely take this on the go for a liquid breakfast. Pricing is fair for what you get too and it kept me pretty full for awhile!

So you come to Vegas and you might have failed at the pre-partying so you arrive at the club and you are shocked by the prices of all the drinks at the clubs. $20 a pop and even $10 for a mini size bottle of water because they won't serve you plain iced tap water. So you still get a round of drinks you are down $200 in a matter of five minutes. That is for reals a bummer. You aren't going to find anything cheap in Vegas unless you are sitting at a table or slot machine and waiting for the cocktail ladies to come by and then you tip her for her courteous delivery of your drink. But that takes forever and by the time she comes by, you might also be down $150 in blackjack...

So Centrifuge is right outside Hakkasan. So why would you want to pay $20 for a drink when you can pay $10 or even less? So you must arrive at Hakkasan a bit early to ensure that you can still get in or else you are just as screwed because you will be waiting in a massive line and your buzz will be gone. Anyways, definitely come here for the cheaper price drinks. When I went, they had a beer and shot special for $8. That's like winner winner chicken dinner in my book. The drinks themselves are OK. Nothing too special but seriously, they taste the same inside Hakkasan anyways; the bump to 4 stars is really for the deal that you will be getting for drinking out here right before entering the club and paying an arm and a leg.

We were staying at Bally's, so this restaurant was close.  Our party of four was seated without a wait.  They had a special burger (choice of cheese, choice of fries and choice of beer) for somewhere around 19.99.

Three of our party (including me) got the burger special.  I ordered a medium burger with cheddar cheese, regular fries and a root beer.  I was supposed to get a beer with my meal but it was too early in the day for me to have a beer.  The waitress agreed to let my sub. root beer for beer.  Our food came out hot and within a reasonable amount of time.  

No complaints.  The burger was juicy and flavorful.  The fries were good.  I really enjoyed the root beer since it has been awhile since I had one  My daughter and son-in-law enjoyed their burger special also,  They had theirs the proper way, with a beer.

My wife had the chipotle chicken skewers.  She enjoyed her selection.  I stole a bite.  I have to agree that the chicken was good.  

Our waitress was friendly, fast and efficient.

I enjoyed the meal and can appreciate the fact that they serve burgers that are a step above but I also think the price is also a step above.

They served it in 2 plates with two meatballs on each plate and two slices of garlic bread.  The bread was pretty saturated with garlic butter and I didn't eat both pieces.  The spaghetti and meatballs tasted good and I wasn't able to eat all of my serving.

I received texts and emails letting me know when it was ready so I didn't waste a drive down there. Also, they ask about combining the gifts into one box or keeping them in separate boxes. It was easy when I got there - just gave them my name, order number, and a guy from the back brought out the gift. 

I also was looking for an umbrella stand, which I realize probably isn't a common item to find. however, I had three wonderful staff associates helping me, relaying to each other about things in the back and searching two floors for the one we saw online.

I would like to think of myself as a foodie but the truth is my tastes just don't quite reach that level of out of the box eating (for an American). I will say this is a great restaurant though. I was not overly fond of the menu, but the food I ate was really good. I started out with an endive salad that had a cave aged thomme dressing on it and had prosciutto, candied walnuts, etc. I liked it a lot. Then I had the Texas Wild boar Chops which came with lobster mac and cheese and pork belly topped with roasted pear. I'm not a big lobster person but overall the mac and cheese was really good. The chops were cooked to my specifications and were tender and the pork belly was a nice touch as well. They brought us out a starter of lobster bisque and a cheese biscuit in the cutest teeny tiny mugs. They also brought out a brioche bun. The food is pretty classy I have to say and the glass of wine I had was nothing short of perfection. So if you are into French food and foi gras, and sweet breads and that kind of thing definitely check them out. I probably won't be back just because it's not my thing, but my friend said it's his favorite restaurant that he's tried recently.

I have no idea where to begin! Seriously. 

Very cozy, not-so-churched up yet elegant ambience. 

We sat down and were immediately greeted by Kyoko, our waitress, who got our drink orders out of the way and explained the menu to us newcomers. 

Whilst perusing the menu we were pleasantly surprised with a gift of chicken liver/ port wine pâté with accompanying toast. 11/10!!!! At the expense of losing it as a free app. I strongly urge them to up the quantity and add it to the paid app list. 

After we demolished the pâté, we were yet again granted manna from heaven. Gruyere popovers served with butter, sea salt, and the recipe! 
So good! It was a struggle to not finished them, as I knew what was in store for the PAID apps, main and sides. 

APPS: 

Chef special: Escargot made with preserved Meyer lemon, garlic and 
chives. Not so much traditional, but so very good =P 

Roasted beets with apple and chevre. Still tastes like beets! 
It was not very memorable, let's just leave it at that. 

MAINS: 

Spice rubbed cowboy ribeye! Oh yes. I usually go with plain steaks. No foo foo shit for me thanks. HOWEVER, I figured what the hell, I ordered the beets didn't I? When it came I immediately removed the chili butter, tasted it by itself then put it back on the steak. Pittsburgh style rare done perfectly. Accompanying head of roasted garlic and marrow bone were also friggin' spectak! =P 

Cheeseburger and Fries for the dot. Pretty good burger and (whining voice) ""these are too salty"" cone of fries (she finished them anyway ;)) Also came with a side of really delicious cole slaw =P 

Braised short ribs. Fall apart tender and just ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous! Even as a nuked leftover, every bite was as savory as the night before =P 

SIDES: 

I could eat the grilled asparagus all day long. ALL.DAY.LONG. my favorite by far. 

Au Gratin Potatoes were tender and ooey gooey 

Braised carrots were pretty standard and forgettable, eh. 

Hen of the woods mushrooms were pretty good as well. Would skip next time though and replace with spinach maybe...

The waitress, sorry I can't remember her name then took our order. We started with the calamari which wasn't anything spectacular, but was good nonetheless. The calamari was served with your standard lemon wedge, and tzatziki sauce. The calamari rings were also quite tender.
My wife ordered the feature, which was Mahi Mahi. The presentation of the food was good, and she also said it tasted very good. I ordered the greek ribs. It was a full back of ribs, that came with veggies like brocolli, small squash, and also greek potatoes.
My ribs were fall off the bone tender. I would definitely order the ribs again. It was too bad we both couldn't finish our entree's. Next time we won't order an appetizer.

With the two entree orders, the calamari appy and one soft drink, the bill came to around $75.00 with tip included.

The waitress also was very good at refilling the drinks.

My friends and I came here late one night because it was the only place open after midnight at Mandalay Bay (the only one we found, anyway). What awaited us was the worst waste of $80 the world has every seen. I'm hoping that it was just because we were there so late (and maybe they have the crap cooks/bartenders working the late-late shift), but I have my doubts.

We started by ordering a few cocktails...and perhaps that was our mistake. Afterall, it's not a bar...but still, you'd think that they couldn't screw them up too badly. Somehow, though, my Tom Collins and my friends' Amaretto Sour and Long Island Iced Tea all ended up tasting exactly the same...how is that possible, you may ask? I have no idea. They're all three very different drinks...and yet they were indistiguishable save by color. 

We were, however, willing to overlook crappy drinks because we were hungry and all we wanted was food. My friend and I split the Spinach & Artichoke dip...and were very sad we did. It was decidedly the worst I've ever had. It kind of tasted like it was from a box, or was leftover and had been warmed up for the occasion. Yikes.

My friends ordered a few other food items, which were better than the dip, but nothing to write home about. All in all, we ended up spending a collective $80, and not one of us felt that a single thing we'd ordered was worth it...bummer! Definitely won't go here again, no matter the hour!",5aEtVEtCBLIX4tEuX1i3Hw,1

He put on the most entertaining show we attended, during this particular trip to Vegas.  Highly reccomended.  He was hilarious from beginning to end, never slowing down at all. 

He has a rare talent, combining a genuine gift for comedy and celebrity impersonations. You could tell he was improvising some of the skits, adding on items he picked out (or people he picked on) in the audience. Really a funny, funny guy.

What set my sandwich apart, was the Italian dressing, it brought all the flavored together and made it a very tasty meal. Even a better one a couple hours later when I ate the other half at work. 

Natasha (wife), got a turkey sandwich, it had bacon and avocado in it, the bacon was too crispy, and the cream cheese was just chunked in there, maybe great for some people but she didn't care for both the bacon or cream cheese. Once she removed those ingredients, she enjoyed her meal.

While this is upscale Mexican food with an amazing and very large tequila menu, I have to urge you to order the Sangria...

The Sangria at Diego was made with the perfectly-in my opinion- This is the perfect drink after laying in the sun all day. It's as refreshing as it gets. 

Of course the margaritas are amazing here with lots of various choices, including my favorite Skinny Margarita. So, these aren't to be missed either. 

Like others have said, the chips served with 3 salsas and 3 blended salts are awesome! I had these on more than 1 occasion...

We also ordered the grilled chicken salad and chicken enchilada suiza. Both were very good. The kids meal was actually a great deal at just 7.00 for beef taquitos with rice, beans and churro for dessert...They thought there meal was the best they've had in quite awhile when eating out..

Service was terrific and the ambience was very inviting...

Now, we stayed at the Signature at MGM, so Diego was very convenient and kid friendly. Had we not stayed here we may not have made a trip just to eat here. This is simply because there are just soooo many restaurants to try in Vegas that you can usually just stay at your own hotel and find great places check out...

Don't get me wrong, I loved the Fort Mill stadium, but always seemed like it was so far removed from Charlotte and surrounding.  There was plenty of parking, which was a plus, but it seemed like you went to the game got your hot dog, snacks, beer, and entertainment and then got in the car and left.  At least with a stadium downtown, there is so much more potential to get the Knights into the fold for your daily activities.

Hang out in the new RB park right next door or the French Quarter in the Latta Arcade strip before the game...  That's what my friends and I did before we got to the sold out game.  

We had SRO tickets and I was a little leery about it, but it turned out great!  Aside from the grassy berm to sit on, there are plenty of places to stand behind the regular seats... even a waist high table to set drinks/food on along the outer perimeter.  The field is sunken in so there as a great view of the action from any perspective.

Another great opportunity the builders of the stadium took advantage of was Charlotte's craft brewing scene.  You can get NoDa Breawing, TripleC, Birdsong, and Old Meck of the tap.  There are plenty of food stands along the perimeter of the whole place!

There looks like there are plenty of private boxes above...  I've only had the pleasure of watching a Knights game from a box once, but something about being outside in the fresh air, cold beer in hand, and sun on your face that totally says baseball to me.",Ry1O_KXZHGRI8g5zBR3IcQ,1

It was a nice size with sliced chicken, sliced tomatoes, hard boiled egg, and cheese on iceberg lettuce. Overall, it was fresh, but the chicken had absolutely no seasoning. My friend suggested they don't season things due to the number of elderly that eat here. The cheese was imitation cheese, which I don't like.

This led him to resolve my left knee issues, aid in the recovery of my right knee (I have had multiple surgeries on this joint), and completely resolved the pain in my left foot and lower back.

It was over seasoned though and we were pretty thirsty afterwards.

Their menu is really big and the food is pretty decent overall.",Ri0lqYogDIS_0zEBzQHjVQ,0

DO get huli huli chicken tacos from this place. It has great flavor and wasn't dry.

DO NOT: Get a salad here. It's just sad. It's like when you go to PTs or some type of bar and they have pancakes on the menu. You could totally order pancakes, but you probably shouldn't. I understand that you want to give people options but when you serve a salad the way they do, it's best not to. 

The salad was on a bed of lettuce. Or so they said. I couldn't find much lettuce. I also got grilled veggies, trying to be a little healthier I suppose. Well technically, it is ""veggies"" as it was TWO types of pepper, green and red. They weren't grilled when I was there, so they were just cold and limp. It wasn't appetizing.

There was shredded cabbage and very light green and very light. I also got black beans, and when I did get a bite of black beans in it, it added flavor. I also got tortilla strips which I could barely find as well. Bean sprouts were in there. I also received guacamole (included in the price of the grilled veggies) and it was the biggest scoop of guacamole I've ever seen. Didn't help the salad at all, as guacamole is a transport or vessel for flavor, NOT flavor itself. 

I still like the place as their burrito bowls and tacos are very good. They have great salsas and the meats are very good. Stick with that. Other places like Cafe Rio and Chipotle do a decent job of salad. Those salads aren't your idea of the most healthy salads, but I can always recall seeing much more lettuce and greens in those salads than what I got today. 

Don't let this dissuade you from eating here at all, but just know that just because they offer salads, doesn't mean you should get it.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,0

The order nevertheless came out fast but if they get a rush there could be a problem.  I ordered the  chicken super burrito which was very tasty ..  Its only super because of what's added in it and not the size.  The size of the burrito is similar to Chipotle's.  Ordered a drink but had no refills.  The price was around $9 which is again similar to Chipotle.  The napkins provided on the table are the ones you have to use  dozen to do the job.  Restroom was out of hand soap.

Saw several pieces of mid century furniture that we were interested in buying. The first was a set of stacked cabinets that had no price. When I asked for the price I was told it wasn't for sale because he was using it for display. Okay that's not totally unreasonable except it only had two open shelves and the rest were closed cabinets so it wasn't displaying much. When I turned to the cabinet beside it that did have a price I was told that the way it works if you want to buy any of the larger pieces of furniture is that you can't take it with you on the same day you buy it but rather he will call you when he has time to move all the little things that are be displayed on it and finds somewhere else to put them. What?!?  He wasn't phased when I tried to explain to him that I was just traveling through and would be two states away by then. I did find a two piece credenza hutch that was priced and since it only had a couple of things on it I thought for sure I could talk him into selling it to me and taking it with me but he was convinced that the top hutch did not go with the bottom credenza and it did not belong to him. When I suggested that he call the seller he said he doesn't call sellers on Sunday. WTF? He said he would email the seller. Grrr. I left buying only a couple of books but could have easily dropped over a grand. I said I would be in town for an hour or two because I had an appointment to pick up some furniture so if he happened to hear back he could call me. He called me back several hours later saying that I was right, the price was for both pieces DUH. Unfortunately I was already a state away by then. I have no idea what the hell this guy is thinking. More than 90% of the storefronts on this street are closed and boarded up. Have no idea how this place is still in business when they are turning away customers.

They seem very upset to be there and god forbid you have price match to do they're going to literally analyze every detail to drag the time out.. if you buy groceries and actually work in a grocery environment you should know what the products look like.. no rocket science needed here.

I literally dread coming here.. if you're looking for a better location, try the one in Oakville.. the produce is way, way better and the people who work there are so friendly.. 

I use to hate that saying if you don't like your job then quit but seriously why are you here to bring hell to people's day??? Put a smile on your face and say hello the customers, they will actually appreciate it.

Also beware, they hire cashiers with clearly no cashier experience. I had a situation when I last visited where the cashier logged in onto her system somehow that I was using a credit card but it was my debit. 

I had to take all of my items out of my bags and re scan them.., I tell you as a mom of three with a very busy life I just don't have time for these issues..

We had the pork belly tacos - dry and tasteless, the carne asada tacos - just plain tasteless, and the short ribs tacos - how can you possibly have no flavor with a sriracha sauce, but they didn't.  The rice had no seasoning and the lentils???  Lentils, really???  The queso fundido was runny and greasy and a very skimpy portion.  The strawberry margarita tasted like strawberry syrup.  Very disappointing.
I'm giving them 2 stars because our waiter was very nice and attentive.  It is totally overprices for what they are serving.",CErv0WFtzbx5dIMjunoepw,0

They took our drinks away as soon as they were empty and didn't ask if we wanted more. Small complaint but still great beer.",xy41sqkMHJC03jECOPQVzg,0
